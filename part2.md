## What is Dark Academia?

**Dark Academia** is a subculture and aesthetic that draws inspiration from classical literature, art, and education, often blending romanticism with themes of melancholy and existentialism. It typically features:

- **_Setting and Atmosphere_**: Environments reminiscent of old universities, libraries, and Gothic architecture. The mood is often moody, introspective, and nostalgic.

- **\*Themes**: Focus on knowledge, learning, and the pursuit of truth, often intertwined with darker themes such as mortality, obsession, and the human condition.

- **_Fashion_**: Characterized by preppy, vintage styles, including blazers, turtlenecks, plaid skirts, and dark color palettes, often accented with accessories like glasses and scarves.

- **_Literature and Art_**: Emphasis on classic works, particularly from authors like Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, and the Brontë sisters, as well as an appreciation for poetry, philosophy, and the arts.

**_synopsis:_**

Oliver Marks has just served ten years in jail - for a murder he may or may not have committed. On the day he's released, he's greeted by the man who put him in prison. Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he does, he wants to know what really happened a decade ago.

As one of seven young actors studying Shakespeare at an elite arts college, Oliver and his friends play the same roles onstage and off: hero, villain, tyrant, temptress, ingenue, extra. But when the casting changes, and the secondary characters usurp the stars, the plays spill dangerously over into life, and one of them is found dead. The rest face their greatest acting challenge yet: convincing the police, and themselves, that they are blameless

Todd Anderson and his friends at Welton Academy can hardly believe how different life is since their new English professor, the flamboyant John Keating, has challenged them to "make your lives extraordinary! " Inspired by Keating, the boys resurrect the Dead Poets Society--a secret club where, free from the constraints and expectations of school and parents, they let their passions run wild. As Keating turns the boys on to the great words of Byron, Shelley, and Keats, they discover not only the beauty of language, but the importance of making each moment count. But the Dead Poets pledges soon realize that their newfound freedom can have tragic consequences. Can the club and the individuality it inspires survive the pressure from authorities determined to destroy their dreams?

### Babel

**_synopsis:_** 1828. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he’ll enroll in Oxford University’s prestigious Royal Institute of Translation—also known as Babel. The tower and its students are the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver-working—the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars—has made the British unparalleled in power, as the arcane craft serves the Empire's quest for colonization.

For Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide . . .

Can powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?
